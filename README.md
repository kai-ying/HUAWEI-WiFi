# HUAWEI-WiFi
华为第一届Wi-Fi感知大赛，参加这次比赛比较匆忙，成绩也不是特别好，成绩刚过60，在榜单的第17名WWG。

总结原因，主要是：
1.数据信息没有充分使用：数据只使用了幅度，没有用到相位信息；
2.数据0，1分布不均匀，特别容易过拟合，甚至训练效果不如瞎猜；
3.DL训练问题，没有多试几种网络，神经网络结构微调都没做；
4.没有物理建模，只是使用了数据+深度学习，无法物理层面解释。


Huawei's first Wi-Fi perception competition, participating in this competition was in a hurry, and the results were not particularly good, with a score of just over 60, ranking 17th on the list WWG.

To summarize the reasons, the main ones are:
1. The data information is not fully used: the data only uses the amplitude, and does not use the phase information;
2. The distribution of data 0,1 is uneven, especially easy to overfit, and even the training effect is not as good as blind guessing;
3. For DL training problems, I didn't try several more networks, and I didn't do any fine-tuning of the neural network structure;
4. There is no physical modeling, just data + deep learning is used, which cannot be explained at the physical level.
